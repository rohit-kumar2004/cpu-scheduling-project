# cpu-scheduling-project
This project implements and evaluates four CPU scheduling algorithms: First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), and Round Robin (RR). The project aims to determine the optimal scheduling algorithm based on key performance metrics.

### Introduction
The project provides an implementation of four CPU scheduling algorithms and evaluates them based on average waiting time, average turnaround time, CPU utilization, and throughput. It determines the optimal algorithm for a given set of processes and displays the results.

### Features
- Implementation of FCFS, SJF, SRTF, and RR scheduling algorithms
- Calculation of performance metrics for each algorithm
- Comparison of algorithms to determine the optimal one
- Display of the optimal algorithm and its performance metrics
### Installation
#### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or any C++ IDE
- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or MSVC)
#### Steps of usage:
