# cpu-scheduling-project
This project implements and evaluates four CPU scheduling algorithms: First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), and Round Robin (RR). The project aims to determine the optimal scheduling algorithm based on key performance metrics.
